##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

#### About the data

From [Human Activity Recognition] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) This database was comprised of the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.


### List of files

* `features.txt`: Names of the 561 features.
* `activity_labels.txt`: Names and IDs 
* `X_train.txt`: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, listing the ID of the volunteer listed in `X_train.txt`.
* `y_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, listing the ID of the activity listed in `X_train.txt`.
* `X_test.txt`: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, listing the ID of the volunteer listed in `X_test.txt`.
* `y_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, listing the ID of the activity listed in `X_test.txt`.


### Steps to Analysis

1. installed `dplyr` package
2. Files were downloaed via URL, unzipped and processed indivdually
3. created a data table (`data.frame` works but took longer)
4. matched up labels with included `activitylabelsfile.txt` into data table
5. Read in all test data stats
6. Merge with activity labels
7. Repeat with train data
8. Combine the test data and train data
9. Make subjects into factors
10. Write CSV file

### Data files that were not used (as per assignment codebook)
This analysis was performed using only the files above, and did not use the raw signal data. Therefore, the data files in the "Inertial Signals" folders were ignored.
