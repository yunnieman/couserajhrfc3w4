##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

#### About the data

From [Human Activity Recognition] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) This database was comprised of the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.


### List of files

* `features.txt`: Names of the 561 features.
* `activity_labels.txt`: Names and IDs 
* `X_train.txt`: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, listing the ID of the volunteer listed in `X_train.txt`.
* `y_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, listing the ID of the activity listed in `X_train.txt`.
* `X_test.txt`: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, listing the ID of the volunteer listed in `X_test.txt`.
* `y_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, listing the ID of the activity listed in `X_test.txt`.


### Processing steps

1. All of the relevant data files were read into data frames, appropriate column headers were added, and the training and test sets were combined into a single data set.
2. All feature columns were removed that did not contain the exact string "mean()" or "std()". This left 66 feature columns, plus the subjectID and activity columns.
3. The activity column was converted from a integer to a factor, using labels describing the activities.
4. A tidy data set was created containing the mean of each feature for each subject and each activity. Thus, subject #1 has 6 rows in the tidy data set (one row for each activity), and each row contains the mean value for each of the 66 features for that subject/activity combination. Since there are 30 subjects, there are a total of 180 rows.
5. The tidy data set was output to a CSV file.
